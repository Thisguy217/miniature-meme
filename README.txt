# miniature-meme
A simple GUI for playing what do you meme with family photos!

The system runs on Python and all it requires is creating a foler that has all the family photos.
A bug that may become problematic is that sometimes the GUI prints a picture rotated or upside down, I don't know how to fix it or how you would go about fixing it.
I am looking for more collaboration later, but I am still very new to Python so I am not sure how to really fix that bug myself anyway.
