A simple GUI for playing what do you meme with family photos!

The system runs on Python and all it requires is creating a folder that has all the family photos.
A bug that I encounter and sort of patched, really just added a feature, is the GUI printed images at odd angles, so I had to edit it to make it up right either by screen
rotation or by manually shifting my monitor. I added a feature that allows someone to change the angle and update the picture frame, but it has to be done manually which is a 
frustration I am running into. Next update will be to add some better limitations on images becuase some were too small and some were too big, and so I had to adjust size 
manually. I would rather it perform a compression rather than manually dictating what it is. I am still looking for more collaboration, both for ideas and suggestions for edits.
Not sure if this will work on MacOS still, let alone Big Sur, but I need some help with either building a distinct script for that or it will run just fine.
